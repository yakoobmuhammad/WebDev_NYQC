                -Nazeer was my ISO 13485 Lead Auditor
                training instructor. He is very knowledgeable, able to explain
                interpretation nuances in a way that's easy to understand and is
                logical, very friendly and fun to talk to, and goes above and
                beyond when we ask for his help.

                 He made the 4 full day training session enjoyable and
                 intersting. his experience provided a lot of insight on what
                 the standards intend to communicate.

                 I recommned Nazeer as he's a joy to learn from and takes what
                 can oftentimes bea bland topic to something more interesting.

                -Nazeer is a very professional and extremely capable Lead Auditor
                with strong attention to detail. I was very impressed with his
                thorough knowdledge of the Canadian CMDR, US and EU Medical
                Device regulations and wuality system standards (ISO13485). He
                very easily extrapolated these various complex requirements into
                routine QMS processes implemented by corporations. He has a
                wealth of knowledge gained from his many years of technical
                training and in-field medical devices experience. It was a great
                experience working with Nazeer during these past few years
                including our MDSAP certification and the surveillance
                assesssments.
